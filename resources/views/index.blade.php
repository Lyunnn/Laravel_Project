        <p class="mx-20 pt-10 pb-10">In fact, I discovered that I was interested in the IT field after graduating from
            high school. After consideration, I decided to study in a major that I am unfamiliar with. In the
            beginning, I encountered difficulties and felt stressed. However, the assistance from friends and tutors,
            as well as the passion for IT always motivates me. In addition, there is a sense of accomplishment that
            makes me feel delighted every time I complete a project.<br><br>The most important thing for me now
            is to keep learning to improve my self-worth, and successfully graduate from university. In the
            future, I plan to seek a job and become an IT pro after years of passing.
